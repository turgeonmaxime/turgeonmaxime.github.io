I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Statistics](https://sci.umanitoba.ca/statistics/) at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/).

I received a PhD in Biostatistics from McGill University in 2019 while working under the supervision of [Dr. Celia Greenwood](https://greenwoodlab.github.io/) and [Dr. Aurélie Labbe](https://chairesd.hec.ca/en/). The title of my PhD thesis is [Dimension Reduction and High-Dimensional Data: Estimation and Inference with Application to Genomics and Neuroimaging](theses/MaximeTurgeon_PhDthesis.pdf).

In a previous life, I also received an MSc in Mathematics from McGill University. My [thesis](thesis.pdf) work was in the field of arithmetic geometry, and it explored a "relative fundamental lemma" that connects distinguished representations on the unitary group of rank 4 with those on general linear groups. It was written under the supervision of [Dr. Jayce R. Getz](https://sites.duke.edu/jgetz/), who is now at Duke University.

Finally, from 2016 to 2019, I was also a senior biostatistician with the [Saskatchewan Health Authority](https://www.saskhealthauthority.ca/) in Saskatoon, SK.

## Research Interests

My main research interests are dimension reduction methods for high-dimensional data. This includes linear approaches (e.g. PCA, CCA, PCEV, PLS) as well as nonlinear approaches (e.g. manifold learning, autoencoders). High-dimensional data is challenging to analyse because of the so-called “curse of dimensionality”. However, we can mitigate this curse by using the structure in the data to our advantage.

I am interested in developing statistical methodologies that are statistically and computationally efficient. I am also interested in applications to statistical genetics, genomics, and neuroimaging.
